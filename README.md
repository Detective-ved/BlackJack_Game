# BlackJack_Game
PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This project is a simple command-line version of the popular card game Blackjack, also known as 21. The aim of the game is to simulate the player-vs-dealer dynamics of blackjack, following the standard rules of the game. Players aim to beat the dealer by having a hand value closest to 21 without exceeding it.

FEATURES:
Player vs. Dealer gameplay
Randomized card dealing using a standard 52-card deck
Real-time score calculation
Ability to hit (get a new card) or stand (keep the current hand)
Automatic dealer play based on standard blackjack rules
Display of game outcomes (win, lose, or draw)

RULES FOR THE GAME:
The player and the dealer both start with two cards.
Cards 2-10 are worth their face value, face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10, and Aces are worth either 1 or 11, depending on which benefits the hand.
The player can choose to "Hit" (draw another card) or "Stand" (keep their current hand).
The dealer must draw cards ("Hit") until their hand is at least 17.
The goal is to get as close as possible to 21 without going over. If either the player or dealer exceeds 21, it's called a "Bust," and they lose the game.
The player wins if their hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer’s, or if the dealer busts and the player does not.

HOW TO PLAY:
After starting the game, both the player and dealer will receive two cards.
The player can choose to:
Hit: Draw another card.
Stand: Keep their current hand.
The dealer will automatically play according to standard blackjack rules.
The game will display the result of each round, showing whether the player won, lost, or tied.
